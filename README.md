Modular Neural Network Platform


This is an attempt to make an easy-to-use neural network simulation platform on Python.  

Specifically, I want to enable evolutionary, genetic algorithms for neural network optimization.


Current Status

The neural network works surprisingly well

the evolutionary search is still somewhat buggy




TO DO

SAVE/LOAD state of neuronal configuration in easily readable format

High level abstract way to connect separate units

In Multi-Unit systems, Unit-level I/O's exist, but system-level I/O's needed.  

Testing on a system's basis with customizeable fitness function
